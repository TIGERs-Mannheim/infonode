# infonode
Non official mirror of the InfoNode docking windows framework. The contrib branch contains minor fixes and changes released under the MIT license.

## Differences to forked repository

 * I changed the POM so that a "mvn install" with JDK8 works (there were JavaDoc issues and it asked for a GPG passphrase
 * I changed the version from 1.6.1 to 1.7.0, as there are several changes on the original branch
 * I added this README

## Maven repository
